# 3D Shirt Showcase 👕  
*A reactive, immersive display of a 3D shirt model using React and Three.js*

---

## 🎨 Overview  
This project is a single-page web app that renders a **rotatable, interactively viewable 3D shirt model**. Built using **React**, with **Three.js** for 3D visualization, along with standard **HTML** and **CSS** for layout and styling, it delivers a seamless and engaging user experience.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **React** – for building a modular, component-driven interface  
- **Three.js** – for rendering the 3D object (shirt) and managing the scene  
- **HTML & CSS** – to structure the page and style UI elements  
- **JavaScript** – for logic, interactivity, event handling
